The last drawing tool you will ever need.

## Gemini Powered
This project harnesses the sophisticated generative AI of Gemini to revolutionize the artistic workflow. By understanding and interpreting natural language prompts, Gemini serves as a powerful creative partner. It can generate foundational sketches from a simple description, intelligently apply color palettes to line art, or transform a basic drawing into a photorealistic masterpiece. This capability allows artists to rapidly explore concepts and bring their ideas to life with unprecedented speed and flexibility.

## Human Tweakable
The creative process is a loop of generation and refinement. This tool embraces that by allowing seamless human intervention. Gemini can deconstruct a photorealistic image or a finished digital painting back into an editable pencil sketch. This "reverse-rendering" provides a unique starting point for modification. Using a suite of intuitive and powerful WebGL-powered tools—like smudge, rotate, and blur—artists can manually tweak the sketch with precision. Once the adjustments are complete, Gemini can re-render the edited sketch, transforming it back into a polished, high-fidelity image that incorporates the artist's specific changes.

## Super-Resolution
Achieving high fidelity across an entire large-scale image can be computationally expensive. This tool introduces a targeted super-resolution feature to solve that problem. When specific areas of an image require finer detail—such as facial features, intricate textures, or small text—the artist can select just that region for enhancement. The tool then intelligently upscales and refines only the selected portion, rather than processing the entire canvas. This localized approach dramatically improves performance, enabling artists to create highly detailed work efficiently, even on workstations with limited hardware resources.

Within this high-resolution context, the full image-to-sketch-to-image workflow is available. The artist can deconstruct the upscaled section into a detailed sketch, apply precise manual edits with the WebGL tools, and then have Gemini re-render it back into a photorealistic image, seamlessly integrating the refined details back into the main artwork.
