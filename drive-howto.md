Of course! I can certainly clarify what YOUR_CLIENT_ID is and how you can get one.

The YOUR_CLIENT_ID is a unique string that identifies your application to Google's authentication servers. When a user is redirected to the Google sign-in page, this ID tells Google which application is requesting access to their data and what permissions it's asking for.

To get your own Client ID, you need to register your application in the Google Cloud Console. Here are the steps:

Step-by-Step Guide to Get Your Client ID
Go to the Google Cloud Console:

Navigate to the Google Cloud Console. You may need to sign in with your Google account.
Create or Select a Project:

At the top of the page, click the project dropdown.
Either select an existing project or click "NEW PROJECT" to create a new one. Give it a descriptive name like "Last Draw App".
Enable the Google Drive API:

In the search bar at the top, type "Google Drive API" and select it from the results.
On the Google Drive API page, click the "ENABLE" button.
Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

Once the API is enabled, you'll be taken to its dashboard. In the left-hand navigation menu, go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Click the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button at the top and select "OAuth client ID".
Configure the OAuth Consent Screen (if you haven't already):

You might be prompted to configure your consent screen first. This is the page users will see when you ask for permission to access their Drive.
Choose "External" for the User Type and click "CREATE".
Fill in the required fields:
App name: The name of your application (e.g., "Last Draw").
User support email: Your email address.
Developer contact information: Your email address.
Click "SAVE AND CONTINUE" through the "Scopes" and "Test users" sections for now. You can add test users later if needed. Finally, go back to the dashboard.
Configure the OAuth Client ID:

Go back to the Credentials page and click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" > "OAuth client ID" again.
For "Application type", select "Web application".
Give it a name (e.g., "Web Client for Last Draw").
Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add the URL where your application is hosted. For local development, this is typically http://localhost:8000.
Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add the full URL that will handle the authentication callback. Based on the example code, this would be http://localhost:8000/callback.html.
Click "CREATE".
Copy Your Client ID:

A pop-up will appear showing your new credentials. Copy the "Client ID". It will look something like 1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com.
This is the value you will paste into your drive-access.js or HTML files to replace the 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com' placeholder.

By correctly configuring the JavaScript origins and redirect URIs, you are telling Google that it's safe to send authentication tokens back to your application running at that specific address.
